how to make ice cream 

ingridents
1 cup of half-and-half
2 tablespoons of granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract
3 cups of ice
1/3 cup of kosher salt
Toppings of your choice

Step 1
Mix the half-and-half, sugar, and vanilla in a resealable bag. Push as much air as you can out of the bag before you seal it. 

Step 2
Place the ice and the kosher salt in another resealable bag.

Place the sealed half-and-half mixture into the bag with the ice. Now seal up that outer bag.

Vigorously shake the bags for 5 to 10 minutes. When finished, the half-and-half mixture will harden to form ice cream. 

Step 5
Add toppings and enjoy.
